Read the problem on the board and write your solution in the body of the
find_floor() function below.
Do not change the arguments passed in the function.
You are not allowed to access the break_point attribute of Eggs A/B.
You can however create additional functions to aide in solving the problem.

If you're stuck try the following before raising your hand:
Try to solve the problem with pen/paper, giving height an easily maintainable
value and writing the solution in pseudocode, or even plain english (whichever
you find more helpful).
If you're not already working in a pair, ask a classmate for a second opinion.
(I encourage you to work in pairs, though you both must still submit your own
assignments).
