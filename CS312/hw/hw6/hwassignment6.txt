1. In your own words, explain what each of the following statements mean:

  A. T(n) is Θ(g(n))

    This means that the growth rate (n increasing) of T(n) is the same as the
    growth rate of g(n) and g(n) describes the exact (or tight) bound of T(n).

  B. T(n) is O(g(n))

    The growth rate of T(n) will always be less than or equal to the growth
    rate of g(n) and g(n) describes the upper bound of T(n).

  C. T(n) is Ω(g(n))

    The growth rate of T(n) will always be greater than or equal to the growth
    rate of g(n) and g(n) describes the lower bound of T(n)


2. Explain why the statement, "The running time of algorithm A is at least
   O(n^2)," is meaningless.

    It is meaningless because O-notation describes the upper bounds of a
    a function/algorithm and is used to describe the max amount of steps that
    an algorithm will take to execute. This means that 'Algorithm A' can very
    well take fewer than n^2 steps to execute thus making the statement false.
