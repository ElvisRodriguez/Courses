Question 1:
  The insert function is implementing lines 5 through 8 of the
  insertion-sort algorithm.

Question 2:
  Part A:
  It is the finding the position in array A where the key is less than or
  equal to all values after its position and is greater than or equal to
  all values preceding its position. For each time the function finds a
  value at an index of A greater than the key, that value is moved further
  forward in the array until the key reaches it's appropriate (sorted) position.
  Part B:
  The function assumes that the subset of array A[0:i] is already sorted.
