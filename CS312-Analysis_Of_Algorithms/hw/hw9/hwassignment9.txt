                     Apple   Blueberry Coconut   Peach
                                                     \
                                                      Raspberry

3. How are the elements in each of the following STL template classes stored?
   Indicate whether the class allows duplicate values to be inserted, whether
   the items are automatically sorted, and the big-O time that it would take to
   search for a random value in the container.

   a. set<item>
    Underlying storage: Binary Search Tree.
    Does it allow repetitions?: No
    Does it automatically sort the items?: Yes
    Big-O search: O(log n)

  b. multiset<item>
    Underlying storage: Binary Search Tree.
    Does it allow repetitions? Yes
    Does it automatically sort the items? Yes
    Big-O search: O(log n)

  c. vector<item>
    Underlying storage: Dynamic Array.
    Does it allow repetitions? Yes
    Does it automatically sort the items? No
    Big-O search: O(n)

  d. list<item>
    Underlying storage: Doubly Linked List.
    Does it allow repetitions? Yes
    Does it automatically sort the items? No
    Big-O search: O(n)

  e. stack<item>
    Underlying storage: Default is deque, but container class is specified upon
                        creation (can also be a vector or list).
    Does it allow repetitions? Yes
    Does it automatically sort the items? No
    Big-O search: O(n)

  f. queue<item>
    Underlying storage: Default is deque, but container class is specified upon
                        creation (can also be a list).
    Does it allow repetitions? Yes
    Does it automatically sort the items? No
    Big-O search: O(n)

  g. map<key,item>
    Underlying storage: Binary Search Tree
    Does it allow repetitions? Keys must be unique, but two keys can have the
                               same items.
    Does it automatically sort the items? Not items, but keys are automatically
                                          sorted.
    Big-O search: O(log n)

  h. multimap<key, item>
    Underlying storage: Binary Search Tree
    Does it allow repetitions? Yes
    Does it automatically sort the items? Not items, but keys are automatically
                                          sorted.
    Big-O search: O(log n)

  i. hash_map<key,item>
    Underlying storage: Binary Search Tree/Dynamic Array? (Documentation
                        mentions buckets, but not what kind of container class
                        those buckets are).
    Does it allow repetitions? Keys must be unique, but two keys can have the
                               same items.
    Does it automatically sort the items? No
    Big-O search: O(n)

  j. hash_multimap<key,item>
    Underlying storage: Binary Search Tree/Dynamic Array? (Documentation
                        mentions buckets, but not what kind of container class
                        those buckets are).
    Does it allow repetitions? Yes
    Does it automatically sort the items? No
    Big-O search: O(n)
