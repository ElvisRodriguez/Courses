**Description:**

*This class defines a Circle with basic attributes:*

    - A center point (x,y)
    - A radius (r)
    - A diameter (d)

*As well as the basic methods:*

    - Circle(), which can either set the center of the Circle
      instance to 0; set them both to the same value if only one
      argument is given; set them to two distinct values if two
      arguments are given.
    - changeCenter(), which changes the center values to the given
      arguments.
    - getCenter_x(), which returns the current value of center_x.
    - getCenter_y(), which returns the current value of center_y.
    - setRadius(), which sets the radius to some nonzero value.
    - setDiameter(), which asserts that the radius is some nonzero
      value and if so, returns the diameter (twice the radius)
    - getRadius(), which returns the value of the radius if it's
      a nonzero value.
    - getDiameter(), which returns the value of the Diameter if it's
      a nonzero value.
    - area(), which returns the area of the circle instance (the
      predefined value of PI times the squared radius)*
    - circumference(), which returns the circumference of the
      circle instance (2 times PI times the radius)

*We based this class on the properties of a circle in the context of a high school geometry course.*
