Convert the following CFG to chomsky normal form:
  A --> BAB | B | 系
  B --> 00 | 系

First add an S to be the new start variable with the rule:
  New rule:
    S --> A

Then eliminate any rule that has a non starting variable becoming an empty
string, in this case the rule B --> 系.
Then add rules to other variables containing B to account for the empty string
possibility.
  New rules:
    A --> AB | BA | A

Then eliminate any rules with more than 3 variables, creating a new variable
for any instance removed.
  New rule:
    A' --> BA

This gives us our new CFG:
  S --> A
  A --> A'B | B | AB | BA | A | 系
  A' --> BA
  B --> 00
