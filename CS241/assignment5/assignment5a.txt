1. Use the multiplication and addition principles to find the count of each of the following events

  (a) If a man has 3 suits, 5 shirts, 4 ties and 2 shoes, how many outfits combinations can he
      wear?

        3 * 5 * 4 * 2 = 120
        He can wear 120 outfit combinations.

  (b) If computer science has 12 types of certifications, mathematics has 5 types of certifications,
      and engineering has 10 types of certifications, how many certifications are available?

        12 + 5 + 10 = 27
        There are 27 certifications available.

  (c) At a restaurant, one can choose from one (1) of two (2) dinner specials. Either choose
      to have 1 out of 4 appetizers, 2 out of 6 entrees and 1 out of 3 beverages; or you can
      choose 2 out of 6 appetizers, 1 out of 6 entrees and 2 out of 5 desserts. How many dinner
      combinations are possible?

        4 * (6 * 5) * 3 = 360
        (6 * 5) * 6 * (5 * 4) = 3600
        3600 + 360 = 3960
        There are 3960 possible dinner combinations.

  (d) How many binary strings of length 8 are palindromes?

        2^4 binary strings.

2. Use the pigeonhole principle to find the count of each of the following events.

  (a) If k pairs of shoes are placed in a bag, how many shoes do you have to remove from the
      bag to guaranteed that two complete pair were removed?

        k + 2 shoes.

  (b) How many cards must be drawn from a standard 52-card deck to guarantee a drawing a
      pair of club card(s?)?

        4 suits of 13 cards each, worst case, every suit has to be removed.
        Worst case: 13(Spades) + 13(Hearts) + 13(Diamonds) + 2(Clubs)
        Worst case: 41 cards must be removed to guarantee drawing a pair of club

  (c) If a jar contains k black marbles and k white marbles, how many marbles must be
      removed to guarantee collecting k âˆ’ 2 marbles of one of the colors?

        2k - 5 marbles must be removed

  (d) Prove that in a group of 25 people that at least 3 people were born in the same month?

        Assuming worst case: 12 containers (1 for each month).
        Assume each person is distributed evenly among the containers.
        If each container held 2 people, the sum of the count of each container
        would be 24, with 1 person left over; that 1 person must belong to some
        container, therefore there will be at least 1 container with 3 people (i.e
        3 people born in the same month).

3. Use permutation and combination to find the count of each of the following events.

  (a) If there is a committee of 13 people, how many president-vice president pairs are possible?

        let n = 13, r = 2
        let P equal the number of possible president-vice president pairs
        P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!
               = 13!/(13-2)!
               = 13!/11!
               = (13 * 12 * 11!)/11!
               = 13 * 12 * 1
               = 156 possible president-vice president pairs.


  (b) From a standard deck of 52 cards, how many five card hands contain a full house (that is,
      three cards with the same face, and the additional cards are a pair)?

        The first part of the hand, the 3-of-a-kind, we have 13 choose 1 choices,
        as for their suits, we have 4 choose 3 possible suits.
        For the rest of the hand, the pair, we have 12 choose 1 choices, as for
        their suits, we have 4 choose 2 possible suits.
        Therefore we have:
        C(13,1) * C(4,3) * C(12,1) * C(4,2)
        13 * 4 * 12 * 6
        3744 five card hands that contain a full house.


  (c) If there is a group of 16 people, how many 3-person committees are possible?

        let n = 16, r = 3
        let C equal the number of possible 3-person committees.
        C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!)
               = 16!/(3!(16-3)!)
               = 16!/(3!*13!)
               = (16 * 15 * 14 * 13!)/(3!*13!)
               = (16 * 15 * 14 * 1)/(3! * 1)
               = 3360/6
               = 560 possible 3-person committees

  (d) If a license plate consists of seven characters that can be letters or digits, how many license
      plates are possible with repetition? without repetition?

        There are 26 letters and 10 digits meaning there are 36 choices for each
        place of the license plate.
        With repetition:
          36^7 = 78364164096 possible license plates
        Without repetition:
          36 * 35 * 34 * 33 * 32 * 31 * 30 = 42072307200 possible license plates

       student being enrolled in biology or chemistry?

          There are 950 students enrolled in biology.
          There are 1000 students enrolled in chemistry.
          1950/5000

       student not being enrolled in computer science?

          There are 1050 students enrolled in computer science.
          Therefore there are 3950 students NOT enrolled in computer science.
          3950/5000
          395/500
          79/100
          79% probability that a randomly selected student is not enrolled in
              computer science.
   (d) If a student is selected at random, what is the probability of the
       student being enrolled in computer science given that the student is
       a man?
          Probability of an event E given F.
          Probability of F = 2500/5000 = 1/2.
          Probability of E intersect F = 850/5000.
          Probability of E|F = (17/100)/(50/100) = 17/50
          34% probability.
