1. Name and describe the 4 major structural components of a CPU.
- The Control Unit, which controls the operations of the CPU and by extension,
  the computer.
- Registers, which the CPU uses for internal storage.
- The ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit), which does data processing for the
  computer.
- The Internal Bus, which connects the other 3 components and allows them to
  communicate.

2. Provide a paraphrase of Moore's Law and state 3 consequences of the law.
Moore's law is the prediction offered by Gordon Moore that the amount of
transistors that could be placed onto a single chip will continue to
double roughly evey year; thus the processing power of computers would
in turn double in the same time frame.
- Consequence 1: the cost of chips remain constant, dramatically reducing
    the cost of computers over the years.
- Consequence 2: Operating speed increases as more components are packed
    closer together.
- Consequence 3: The overall size of computers shrank, while still
    maintaining an increase in power, leading to inventions like the
    smartphone.

3. Name all the registers of the IAS computer, and then, state the purpose of
   any 4 of the registers.
- Memory Buffer Register
- Memory Address Register
- Instruction Register
- Instruction Buffer Register
- Program Counter
- Accumulator
- Muliplier Quotient
- The program counter holds the memory address of the next instruction pair that
  is to be fetched from memory.
- The Instruction Register contains the 8 bit opcode instruction that is
  currently being executed.
- The Instruction Buffer Register temporarily holds the right-hand instruction
  from a word in memory.
- The Memory Buffer Register contains a word to be stored in memory or sent to
  the I/O unit or is used to receive a word from memory/the I/O unit.

4. Convert each of the following binary numbers to decimal numbers:
4a. 1000100.1101
    2^6 + 2^2 + 2^(-1) + 2^(-2) + 2^(-4)
    64 + 4 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.0625
    68 + 0.8125 = 68.8125
4b. 1110.1111
    2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^(-1) + 2^(-2) + 2^(-3) + 2^(-4)
    8 + 4 + 2 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.0625
    14 + 0.9375 = 14.9375
4c. 11111111.11
    2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 + 2^(-1) + 2^(-2)
    128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.25
    255 + 0.75 = 255.75
4d. 11010.0101
    2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^(-2) + 2^(-4)
    16 + 8 + 2 + 0.25 + 0.0625
    26 + 0.3125 = 26.3125
4e. 1010100
    2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2
    64 + 16 + 4 = 84
