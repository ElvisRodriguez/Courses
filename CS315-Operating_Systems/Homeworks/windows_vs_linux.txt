While both are operating systems, Windows and Linux are vastly different in
the way they handle their files, users, directories, etc.

File System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows:
- Files are stored in folders on different data drives like C:D:E:.
- All system/program files are stored - normally - in the C: drive.

Linux:
- Files are ordered in a tree structure starting with the root directory.
- Root directory considered the start of the file system, further branching out
  to other subdirectories.
- System and program files are stored in appropriately named directories; boot
  files are stored in the boot/ directory, program/software files are stored in
  the bin/ directory, etc.

Types of Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux:
- Everything is a file; directories are files, files are files, and devices like
  printers/mouses/keyboards are files.
- General files or ordinary files are the most commonly used files, they can be
  in ASCII or binary format.
- Directory files are warehouses for other file types. Directories can be within
  other directories as subdirectories. They are equivalent to folders in
  windows.
- Device Files are located in the dev/ directory and are represented as files.
  For example, if a hard drive has 3 partitions it would be represented as three
  separate and numbered files.
- All files have permissions (read/write/execute); which permission is available
  to which user depends on what permissions were given to the user by the system
  admin.

Windows:
- Devices (printers/keyboards/hard drives) are represented as drive letters (C:,
  D:, E:, etc).

File Name Convention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows:
- File names are case insensitive, so folders cannot have two files with the
  same name but a different case.
Linux:
- File names are case sensitive, so two files names "example" and "EXAMPLE" are
  allowed in the same directory.

Users
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux:
- Three types of users: regular, administrative (root), service.
- Regular user accounts are created when the OS is installed with all files
  residing in the home/ directory.
- Also created at the time of OS installation, the root user is a superuser who
  can access restricted files, install software and has administrative
  privileges. Users must be logged in as a root user in order to perform and of
  the aforementioned tasks.
- Service accounts are not seen in the desktop version of Linux, but are used
  in servers such as Apache or Squid; they add a layer of security by allowing
  or denying access to various resources depending on the service.

Windows:
- Four types of users: Administrator, Standard, Child, Guest.
- Admin accounts can install software and modify certain non-crucial system
  files.
- Standard and guest accounts are the regular Windows users, though guest
  accounts do not offer the same level of customization.
- Child accounts are Standard accounts that may have certain applications
  restricted based on parental controls set up by the Administrator.
